# Uninstalled Game Finder

This script opens a folder dialog interface allowing you to pick a directory full of pc games. It will check if any are missing a .Exe and list them at the end. This allows you to know if any were uninstalled but left the folder in case you want to delete them. It will not delete them for you unless they are entirely empty in case the folder contains  anything you want to check first.
